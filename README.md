# Node.js Mentorship Program

I am working in NodeJS for about 3 years now, and I also got the best possible job I can get in JavaScript. I learned a lot in my career, and I want to put those skills to good use. I want to work with the developers of the NodeJS team on what they will release or which issues can be solved with fast performance. 

I always guide my fellow mates and juniors on the benefits of open source and how to contribute, so I am very passionate about leading new contributors to what they should work on or whatever questions they have about the NodeJS Architecture. 

I can learn a lot from this cohort because every day, I want to do new things, and I want to know the discipline that Open Source Contributor has in his/her life.

I indeed love to work on every opportunity I get to work closely with NodeJS maintainers. I am very flexible. I surely can't learn fast, but at my pace, I can learn more quickly. I have part of the Open Source Community for a long time, and it's my everyday routine.
